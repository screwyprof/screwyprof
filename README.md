## üß† About Me

> I eliminate the million-dollar risks that keep CTOs awake at 3 AM: system failures that lose revenue, infrastructure that can't scale, and teams that can't deliver reliably.

I build platforms that recover invisibly ‚Äî turning fragile systems into resilient infrastructure that protects revenue, reputation, and business continuity. My expertise spans both technical leadership and hands-on implementation, with 20+ years of systematic approaches to reliability that scale across financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and institutional-grade blockchain technology.

## üìà Key Transformations

**Consistent pattern of turning fragile systems into resilient infrastructure:**

- ‚úÖ **ConsenSys Staking platform ($2+ billion assets)** ‚Üí Built zero-failure backend with institutional-grade safeguards
- ‚úÖ **E-commerce marketplace** ‚Üí Migrated monolith to microservices at Southeast Asia's #1 platform, built backend services handling **16,000+ RPS**
- ‚úÖ **Regulated trading system** ‚Üí Transformed chaotic operations into **99.99% uptime** platform while leading teams through complete system modernization
- ‚úÖ **Distributed RNG protocol** ‚Üí Pioneered on-chain random number generation using cryptographic protocol with `El-Gamal` encryption and `Tendermint` validators.

### Ethereum Ecosystem Contributions

#### [Lighthouse Consensus Client](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)

Resolved critical `OOM` failures causing validator restarts **every 2 hours**, blocking institutional upgrades. Root cause analysis revealed architectural flaw in validator management code - `O(n)` decryption of all keys for single-validator updates. I **transformed O(n) to O(1)** behavior, boosting attestation success rates to **~99%** and unblocking scale operations for tier-1 staking providers. [Problem analysis](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4936) and [solution](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4126).

#### [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost)

Solved fundamental scaling limitation preventing multi-client operations. Introduced **per-validator relay architecture**, delivering **~26% latency improvement** with `OpenTelemetry` instrumentation. [Proposal](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/455) and [solution](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/470).

#### [Autonity Consensus Layer](https://github.com/autonity/autonity)

Integrated Tendermint Proof-of-Stake consensus into go-ethereum before Ethereum's PoS transition. Contributed to consensus engine architecture for decentralized risk markets with delegated PoS and 1-second block times.

## üè¢ Enterprise Systems (Proprietary)

### [Ethereum Staking at ConsenSys](https://consensys.io/staking)

Built backend infrastructure for self-custodial Ethereum Staking powering MetaMask and institutional clients ‚Äî **$2+ billion** in assets across **33,000+ validators**. [Documentation](https://docs.staking.consensys.io/staking-help) and [API reference](https://docs.staking.consensys.io/docs/staking-api).

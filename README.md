### ‚ÄúI stop outages before they happen‚Äù

> I turn fragile architectures into resilient systems that protect revenue, reputation, and customer trust.

---

## üß† About Me

> I eliminate the million-dollar risks that keep CTOs awake at 3 AM: system failures that lose revenue, infrastructure that can't scale, and teams that can't deliver reliably.

I focus on making reliability systematic ‚Äî not reactive. Over 15 years, I've led transformations that made financial, e-commerce, and blockchain platforms scale seamlessly and recover automatically, blending technical leadership with deep engineering discipline.

## üìà Key Transformations

**Consistent pattern of turning fragile systems into resilient infrastructure:**

- ‚úÖ **ConsenSys Metamask Staking ($2+ billion assets)** ‚Üí Helped build failureproof backend for MetaMask Staking and institutional validators, focusing on observability, latency reductions, and safe operations.
- ‚úÖ **Lazada (SEA e-commerce, Alibaba Group)** ‚Üí Helped design and optimize a product-catalog microservice in Go serving **16k+ RPS per instance**; promoted Clean Architecture and TDD practices.
- ‚úÖ **Regulated trading system** ‚Üí Transformed a fragile, monolithic trading system into an event-driven, **99.9%** uptime platform using DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing ‚Äî establishing reliability standards adopted across the team.
- ‚úÖ **Distributed RNG protocol** ‚Üí Pioneered on-chain random number generation using cryptographic protocol with `El-Gamal` encryption and `Tendermint` validators.

### Ethereum Ecosystem Contributions

#### [Lighthouse Consensus Client](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)

Resolved critical `OOM` failures causing validator restarts **every 2 hours**, blocking institutional upgrades. Root cause analysis revealed architectural flaw in validator management code - `O(n)` decryption of all keys for single-validator updates. I **transformed O(n) to O(1)** behavior, boosting attestation success rates to **~99%** and unblocking scale operations for tier-1 staking providers. [Problem analysis](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4936) and [solution](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/4126).

#### [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost)

Solved fundamental scaling limitation preventing multi-client operations. Introduced **per-validator relay architecture**, delivering **~26% latency improvement** with `OpenTelemetry` instrumentation. [Proposal](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/455) and [solution](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/pull/470).

#### [Autonity Consensus Layer](https://github.com/autonity/autonity)

Integrated Tendermint Proof-of-Stake consensus into go-ethereum before Ethereum's PoS transition. Contributed to consensus engine architecture for decentralized risk markets with delegated PoS and 1-second block times.

### üè¢ Enterprise Case Studies

### [Ethereum Staking at ConsenSys](https://consensys.io/staking)

Built backend infrastructure for self-custodial Ethereum Staking powering MetaMask and institutional clients ‚Äî **$2+ billion** in assets across **33,000+ validators**. [Documentation](https://docs.staking.consensys.io/staking-help) and [API reference](https://docs.staking.consensys.io/docs/staking-api).

### [Lazada (Alibaba Group) ‚Äî Southeast Asia‚Äôs leading E-commerce marketplace](https://www.lazada.com/en/)

Contributed to migration of the product-catalog domain from a legacy PHP monolith to distributed Go microservices handling **16k+ RPS per instance** across six markets.
Advocated Clean Architecture and TDD practices across teams, improving reliability and maintainability at scale.

### [Competitive Auction House ‚Äî Regulated Financial Platform](https://www.a-k-d.ru)

Transformed a fragile, monolithic trading system into an event-driven, 99.99% uptime platform using **DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing**.
Introduced CI/CD pipelines and structured on-call processes, establishing reliability standards for the engineering organization.

## üéØ What I'm Looking For

Exploring **Principal Engineer**, **Staff Engineer**, or **Enginering Manager** roles focused on architecture, reliability, and engineering excellence.

I guide teams through technical direction and process design ‚Äî not management hierarchy ‚Äî ensuring systems and practices meet the highest quality standards.

My passion is building infrastructure that must not fail and cultivating the engineering discipline that makes that possible.  

If you're scaling critical systems or modernizing legacy infrastructure, I'd love to discuss how I can help.
